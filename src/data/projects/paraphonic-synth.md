A software synthesizer that emulates the warm and rich sounds of a semi-analog paraphonic synthesizer. This project involves intricate sound design and digital signal processing to capture the nuances of analog hardware.

### Project Goals

The primary goal was to digitally replicate the character of paraphonic synthesizers, where oscillators can play multiple notes but share a single filter and VCA path. This creates unique harmonic interactions not found in fully polyphonic synths.

### Technical Implementation

- **Core Engine:** Developed in C++ for high performance and low-latency audio processing.
- **DSP Algorithms:** Implemented virtual analog oscillators, filters with non-linear behavior, and envelope generators to model analog circuitry.
- **Framework:** The JUCE framework was used for creating the plugin's GUI and ensuring cross-platform compatibility (VST, AU, AAX).
- **Sound Design:** Focused on capturing the subtle imperfections and warmth that give analog synths their desired character.
