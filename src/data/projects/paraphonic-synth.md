A hardware synthesizer built around the Arduino platform, designed to capture the warm and rich sounds of a semi-analog paraphonic synthesizer. This project combines hands-on electronics, embedded programming, and analog circuit design to recreate the unique sonic character of classic hardware synths.

### Project Goals

The main objective was to construct a physical paraphonic synthesizer, where multiple notes can be played simultaneously but share a single analog filter and VCA. This approach produces distinctive harmonic textures and interactions, characteristic of vintage paraphonic instruments.

### Technical Implementation

- **Microcontroller:** Utilized an Arduino as the central controller for note scanning, envelope generation, and parameter modulation.
- **Analog Circuits:** Designed and assembled analog oscillator, filter, and VCA circuits using discrete components to achieve authentic analog warmth and non-linearities.
- **Paraphonic Voice Handling:** Implemented a key scanning matrix and logic to allow multiple notes to trigger the shared analog signal path.
- **User Interface:** Added tactile controls (knobs, switches) for real-time manipulation of sound parameters, and a simple display for patch information.
- **Enclosure & Build:** Crafted a custom enclosure to house the electronics, providing a robust and playable instrument for live performance and studio use.
