This is the main content of your project, written in Markdown. It's rendered just like your old README was.

### Project Goals

The primary goal was to create a seamless user experience for booking appointments. We focused on performance and accessibility from the start.

### Challenges & Solutions

One major challenge was integrating a third-party payment API. We solved this by creating a dedicated serverless function that handles the transaction securely, keeping sensitive keys off the client-side.

- **Feature 1:** Real-time availability checker.
- **Feature 2:** Secure payment processing.
- **Feature 3:** Automated email confirmations.
