An audio plugin that allows for the creative sequencing of various audio effects. This tool enables musicians and producers to apply and automate chains of effects in innovative ways, adding complexity and movement to their sound.

### Project Goals

The objective was to design a production tool that inspires creativity. Instead of static effects, this plugin allows users to create rhythmic patterns of effects (e.g., a reverb on beat 1, a delay on beat 3), turning processing into a performable part of the music.

### Features

- **Modular Design:** Users can load a chain of their favorite VST effects into the sequencer.
- **Step Sequencing:** A familiar step-sequencer interface allows users to enable or disable different effects at different points in a measure.
- **Automation:** Beyond simple on/off, users can automate parameters for each effect on each step, creating intricate, evolving soundscapes.
- **Framework:** Built with C++ and the JUCE framework for robust performance and cross-platform DAW compatibility.
