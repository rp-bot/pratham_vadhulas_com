Cube Climber is a classic 3D platformer game developed from scratch in Processing 4 (Java), featuring real-time 3D graphics and procedural audio. The project highlights skills in creative coding, interactive graphics, and generative sound design.

### Project Goals

The goal was to create a fully playable 3D platformer prototype, demonstrating the ability to design and implement core gameplay, visuals, and audio systems using Processing.

### Development Process

- **Engine & Language:** Built entirely in Processing 4 using Java, leveraging the P3D renderer for 3D graphics.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:** Implemented classic platformer features such as jumping, double-jumping, dashing, and collectible items, all with custom physics and collision logic.
- **Level Design:** Designed multiple levels with distinct layouts, obstacles, and platforming challenges, using procedural generation for some elements.
- **3D Graphics:** Created all 3D models and environments programmatically within Processing, focusing on stylized, geometric visuals.
- **Procedural Audio:** Developed a simple procedural audio system to generate sound effects for actions like jumping, collecting, and environmental feedback, using Processing's sound library.
