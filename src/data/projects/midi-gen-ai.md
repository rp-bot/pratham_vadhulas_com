MIDI Gen AI is a cutting-edge chord prediction tool, designed using a Transformer neural network architecture. This project is a testament to proficiency in AI, music theory, and programming, hosted as a Google Colab notebook on GitHub.

### Project Goals

The objective was to create an AI model that could understand melodic context and predict harmonically coherent chord progressions. This tool is intended to assist musicians and composers in the creative process.

### Methodology & Architecture

- **Model:** A Transformer-based neural network was chosen for its strength in handling sequential data, making it ideal for analyzing musical patterns.
- **Dataset:** The model was trained on a large corpus of MIDI files, learning the relationships between melodies and underlying chord structures.
- **Prototyping:** A fully functional prototype is available as a Google Colab notebook, allowing users to input a melody and receive a generated chord sequence.
