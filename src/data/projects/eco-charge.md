Eco Charge is a mobile application concept aimed at promoting sustainable transportation by helping users find and utilize electric vehicle charging stations powered by renewable energy sources.

### Project Concept

The core idea is to empower EV drivers to make more environmentally friendly choices. The app would not only locate charging stations but also provide data on the source of their power.

### Proposed Features

- **Real-Time Availability:** Integrate with charging station APIs to show real-time availability and reduce wait times.
- **Renewable Energy Filter:** Allow users to filter and find stations that are verified to be powered by solar, wind, or other renewable sources.
- **Eco-Friendly Route Planning:** An intelligent routing system that suggests paths optimized for energy efficiency and access to green charging stations.
- **UI/UX Focus:** A clean, intuitive interface designed to make finding and using green charging stations effortless.
